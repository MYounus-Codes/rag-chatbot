  "short_description": "STORM 2000, STORM 4000 and STORM 6000 use LDI Technology (3D LiDAR mapping + Direct AI processor + Imaging) to deliver self-reliant, boundary-free lawn maintenance without RTK, boundary cables or external signals.",
  "long_description": "STORM is ideal for private gardens and larger green areas. LDI Technology (3D Laser Mapping + Direct AI processor + Imaging) enables advanced obstacle avoidance and navigation without external systems (RTK/GPS, boundary wire, poles or 4G). STORM anticipates routes and avoids both static and moving obstacles — navigating under tree branches, close to walls, and around shrubs without physical boundaries.",
  "features": [
    "Moveable object avoidance (detects obstacles from 1 cm width)",
    "Climb slopes up to 45%",
    "28 cm cutting width; cutting height 3 cm – 8.5 cm",
    "Unlimited cutting zones and flexible no-go zones (via app)",
    "Works completely without RTK/GPS, boundary cables, poles or external signals"

System: mower + charging station + HOOKII Neomow App. Use the App to create maps, set mowing parameters, create No-Go zones and passages, and remotely operate the mower. Installation: prepare lawn (remove obstacles, level holes), choose charging station location with recommended clearances, secure charging station using provided nails or indoor mounting methods. Using STORM: app pairing, map creation, daily mowing, obstacle avoidance, acousto-optic guidance (lights and sound), and maintenance schedule. Maintenance: regular cleaning, consumables replacement, battery care and storage instructions. Troubleshooting and warranty information included. Technical sections (specifications, charging, safety icons) preserved; control-character noise and image references removed for ingestion.",

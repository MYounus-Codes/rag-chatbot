Please contact us if you are in doubt about which models fit in this garage, or see the dimensions of the door above.
We suggest giving the garage a coat of paint or oil, 2-3 times during a 5-7 year time period (lifespan of the robot), to maintain the quality look of the garage. It depends on the climate how much maintenance is needed.

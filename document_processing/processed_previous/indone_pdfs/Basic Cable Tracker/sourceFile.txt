Basic Cable Tracker

Description:
The Basic Cable Tracker works for cables above the ground.
This tracker can locate up to 10 km of cable. You need to hold the tracker on the wire, for it to detect the cable.
The tracker can also be used, if you dig up the buried cable. However, we recommend using our Pro tracker for cables underground.

Description/Information/Details:
STORM Reversible Blades – Efficiency, Durability, Savings.
STORM Reversible Blades are an innovative blade solution for robotic lawn mowers, specifically designed for professional users and the B2B segment, where reliability and total cost of ownership are crucial.
4-Sided Use – Maximum Utilization
Each blade is engineered with four cutting edges, allowing it to be flipped and reused up to four times before replacement is needed. This delivers up to 100% longer lifespan compared to traditional 2-sided blades – a significant saving on maintenance and replacement costs.
Optimized Steel Alloy – Balanced Strength
STORM Reversible Blades are made from a specially developed metal blend that perfectly balances hardness and flexibility:
Impact resistant – will not break upon contact with stones.
Shape stable – resists bending, ensuring consistent cutting and reducing the risk of uneven grass.
